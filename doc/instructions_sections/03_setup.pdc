# Setup

Players should arrange themselves around a table.
Every player receives 20 monies as an initial fund.

The research deck should be split into 3 decks,
one per type of card.
The 3 decks should be placed in the center of the table,
face down.

The user deck should also be placed face down,
in a separate location to the 3 research decks.

The first player is determined by the player with the most
internet connected devices on his person.
