# Setup

Players should arrange themselves around a table.
Every player receives 20 monies as an initial fund.

The research decks (Infrastructure, Protocol, Application)
should be placed in the center of the table,
face down.

The user deck should also be placed face down,
in a separate location to the 3 research decks.

The first player is determined by the player with the most
internet connected devices on his person.
